            <h2>Surrounding Environment</h2>
            <p>I will be talking about what attractions there are in New York City as they are the biggest hot spots in where many people go and visit New York City.  There are
            an uncountable number of attractions are they are close together while being a couple blocks away from each other, allowing for visitors to visit many 
            places all at once.  With the surrounding attractions, it is recommended to stay around 4 to 7 days as you would be able to see all the attractions around you and what
            is out there to do as there are many things that can be done that time should not be wasted!  So when in New York, choose time wisely while picking which
            attractions you would want to go.</p>
